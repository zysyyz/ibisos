# IbisOS
The IbisOS Source Code Guide

Step1, How in the hell do I compile this OS?
well you need to install xorriso, clang, nasm and cmake as well as grub-pc in order to compile the OS, it is reccomended that you use a Linux or BSD distro or just any Unix/Unix-like Operating System like Mac OS, to git clone simply copy the repository link and go into your file manager and right click and open in terminal in the location you want to put the IbisOS source code in, then run git clone (link here) dont put the parenthesis, thats just for example, now that you have done that just enter the IbisOS folder and right click and open in terminal, run chmod a+x ./build.sh then run ./build.sh

Step2, You Have Done it! enjoy that sweet sweet source code and maybe start development on your own IbisOS distribution, we also have a dedicated Discord server called the TINAOS Discord Server, TINAOS was the first name me and 1dime came up with for the OS ThisIsNotAnOperatingSystem TINAOS, lol the name was a joke but anyway here is the link https://discord.gg/DWtFsMm enjoy! :)

A Short but sweet History of IbisOS,
IbisOS was developed by 2 Reddit users over the course of the Covid19 pandemic, Me quinlanfab and 1dime were both very bored and very interested in operating system development, I had made a post on PCMR about a very poorly made OS I made in C# called CHUIOS, yes lads its possible and its kind of odd and I dont see why any OSDEV would want to make an OS in C# LOL but 1dime saw my post and then we got to know eachother, 1dime also did Android app development at the time while I was crazy for programming in C#, im still a terrible programmer by all means but somehow both of us lads managed to make an OS that boots on real hardware, has a gui, fonts, drivers and etc... its amazing how the internet connects us all together, the World Wide Web is full of things. just for some goofy inspiration, if you want to do something just go ahead and do it, if you cant do something one way there is always another way around and thats one of the many formulas that made this project possible. Teamwork is also very important and it is what keeps this project afloat, powered by the community, made by the community.

What even is this Operating System? What Are Even The Goals? Whats going to make it sooooo much better than other current Operating Systems?
We Are working on Making this Operating System to be very easy to use as well as being very complex, well how the heck do you mix easiness with complexity you ask?
well there will be 2 different Desktop Environments to choose from during the installation of IbisOS (Maybe, this isnt final), An Easy and simple desktop for less experienced users and a Complex desktop for Hardcore users. We will also later add support for other current Unix/Unix-Like Desktop Environments. This OS aims to have overall complete control from the user and Complete privacy, IbisOS will not Steal your data, there is no need for your data, everyone should have privacy but in this Modern Age a heck ton of Large Corporations Such as Google and Microsoft are out for your data, IbisOS is your escape from all of that, but what about Linux you ask? if you love Linux and are fine with it there is not much of a reason to want to switch besides our amazing features we are going to offer you the User. We also aim to port existing Linux software. IbisOS also aims to be more Stable than Linux and just a bit more friendly to the user than most distros.
